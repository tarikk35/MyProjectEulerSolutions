A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
"""

# ispalindrome checks if given number is palindrome
# multiplier multiplys values starting from min ending at max
# first loop starts from maximum because we are looking for biggest palindrome
# second loop starts from previous iteration index because computers have feelings,too !
# and then i check if multiplication of two numbers is palindrome and is it biggest
# if yes, change it!
# this solution can work for any properly given ranges.
